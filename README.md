# Real-Time Memory Allocation Tracker
This is a simple Python mini project that simulates memory allocation in an Operating System using Paging and Segmentation techniques. It is made for understanding OS concepts in a practical way.

# About
The program allows the user to allocate and deallocate processes in memory and see how memory changes using:
- Paging with fixed size frames
- Segmentation with variable size blocks
All operations are performed through a menu in the terminal.

# Features
- Paging allocation and deallocation
- Segmentation allocation using first fit
- Display of memory status
- Simple menu driven program
- Easy to understand Python code

# Tech Used
- Python 
- Git and GitHub
# How to Run
1. Open terminal in project folder
2. Run the command:
3. Use the menu to test paging and segmentation.

# Learning Outcome
Understanding of OS memory management
Practice with Python programming
Basics of paging and segmentation
Experience with GitHub version control
